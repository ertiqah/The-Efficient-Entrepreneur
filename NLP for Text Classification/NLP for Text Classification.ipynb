    "\n",
    "Some common regular expression metacharacters - copied from wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "**^**     Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**.**     Matches any single character (many applications exclude newlines, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, a.c matches \"abc\", etc., but [a.c] matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**[ ]**    A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, [abc] matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". [a-z] specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: [abcx-z] matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does [a-cx-z].\n",
    "The - character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the ^, if present) character within the brackets: [abc-], [-abc]. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The ] character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the ^) character: []abc].\n",
    "\n",
    "**[^ ]**   Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, [^abc] matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". [^a-z] matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$**      Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**( )**    Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, \\n). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. BRE mode requires \\( \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\n**     Matches what the nth marked subexpression matched, where n is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\***     Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, ab*c matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. [xyz]* matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. (ab)* matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**{m,n}**  Matches the preceding element at least m and not more than n times. For example, a{3,5} matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. BRE mode requires \\{m,n\\}."
