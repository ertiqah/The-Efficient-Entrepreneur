## Contribution Standards

To maintain the high quality and practical value of this playbook, we adhere to the following standards:

### Adding New Tools or Workflows

1. **Proven Use Case**: Any new tool or workflow must be accompanied by a demonstrated, real-world use case. This should include:
   * A detailed description of the problem it solves
   * Metrics showing its effectiveness (e.g., time saved, ROI, productivity increase)
   * Steps for implementation
2. **Integration**: Explain how the new tool or workflow integrates with existing systems or other tools in the playbook.
3. **Limitations and Challenges**: Be transparent about any limitations or challenges you encountered, and how you addressed them.

### Updating Existing Content

1. **Justification**: Clearly explain why the update is necessary. This could be due to tool changes, new features, improved methodologies, or the use-case was not proven.
2. **Before and After**: If applicable, provide "before and after" scenarios to illustrate the improvement.

### General Guidelines

1. **Clear Writing**: Use concise, clear language. Avoid jargon unless it's industry-standard.
2. **Formatting**: Follow the existing formatting structure of the playbook for consistency.
3. **Ethics**: Ensure all contributions adhere to ethical AI practices and data privacy standards.
4. **Originality**: All contributions must be your own work or properly attributed if building on others' ideas.

### Review Process

1. All contributions will be reviewed by our core team for quality, relevance, and adherence to guidelines.
2. We may suggest edits or ask for more information before merging.
3. Approved contributions will be merged and the contributor will be added to our public list of contributors.

### Recognition

We believe in giving credit where it's due:

1. All contributors will be listed in our `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
2. Significant contributions may be highlighted in our [newsletter ](https://newsletter.ertiqah.com)or social media channels.
3. Top contributors may be invited to join our core team or participate in special projects.

### Collaborative Improvement

We encourage discussion and collaborative refinement of ideas:

1. Use the **Issues** section for discussions about potential improvements or challenges.
2. Engage constructively with other contributors' work through comments and suggestions.

### Community Standards

1. Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
2. Focus on the content of contributions, not on personal characteristics of contributors.
3. Help maintain a welcoming environment for contributors of all experience levels.
