# Competitive Analysis Framework

Conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis for my business. Here's my information:

My Business: [YOUR BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]

For each competitor (and my business), analyze:
1. Product/service offerings
2. Pricing strategy
3. Target audience
4. Marketing channels and messaging
5. Unique selling propositions
6. Customer reviews and sentiment
7. Market share (if available)

Identify our key differentiators and potential areas for improvement. Suggest strategies to gain a competitive edge.
