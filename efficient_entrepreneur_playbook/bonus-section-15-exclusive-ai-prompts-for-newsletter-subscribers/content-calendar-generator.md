# Content Calendar Generator

```
Create a 3-month content calendar for my business's social media and blog. Here's my information:

Business: [YOUR BUSINESS]
Target Audience: [YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE]
Key Products/Services: [YOUR KEY OFFERINGS]
Primary Social Media Platforms: [YOUR PLATFORMS]

For each month:
1. Suggest 4 blog post topics with brief outlines
2. Provide 20 social media post ideas (mix of promotional, educational, and engaging content)
3. Recommend optimal posting times and frequencies
4. Include ideas for user-generated content and engagement strategies

Ensure the content aligns with my business goals and resonates with my target audience.
