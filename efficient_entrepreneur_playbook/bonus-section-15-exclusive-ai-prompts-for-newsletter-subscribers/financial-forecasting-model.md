# Financial Forecasting Model

```
Create a 12-month financial forecasting model for my business. Here's my current financial information:

Monthly Revenue: [YOUR MONTHLY REVENUE]
Monthly Expenses: [YOUR MONTHLY EXPENSES]
Growth Rate: [YOUR CURRENT GROWTH RATE]
Seasonality Factors: [ANY SEASONAL IMPACTS ON YOUR BUSINESS]

The model should include:
1. Monthly revenue projections
2. Expense forecasts (fixed and variable)
3. Cash flow projections
4. Break-even analysis
5. Scenario planning (best case, worst case, most likely case)
6. Key financial ratios to track

Provide explanations for your assumptions and suggestions for how to use this model for decision-making.
