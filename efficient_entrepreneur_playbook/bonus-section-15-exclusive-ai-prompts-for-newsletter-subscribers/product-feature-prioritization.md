# Product Feature Prioritization

```
Help me prioritize new features for my product. Here's the relevant information:

Product: [YOUR PRODUCT]
Target Users: [YOUR TARGET USERS]
Current Key Features: [LIST YOUR CURRENT KEY FEATURES]

Potential New Features:
1. [FEATURE 1]
2. [FEATURE 2]
3. [FEATURE 3]
4. [FEATURE 4]
5. [FEATURE 5]

For each potential new feature:
1. Assess its potential impact on user satisfaction and business goals
2. Estimate the development effort required
3. Evaluate market demand and competitive advantage
4. Identify any potential risks or dependencies

Provide a prioritized list of these features with justifications for the ranking. Suggest a timeline for implementation based on available resources.
