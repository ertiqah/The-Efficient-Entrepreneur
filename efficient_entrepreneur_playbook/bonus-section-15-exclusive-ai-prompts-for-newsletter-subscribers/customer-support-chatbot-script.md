# Customer Support Chatbot Script

```
Design a script for a customer support chatbot for my business. Here's the relevant information:

Business: [YOUR BUSINESS]
Product/Service: [YOUR OFFERING]
Common Customer Issues: [LIST COMMON ISSUES]

The chatbot script should include:
1. A welcoming message
2. Options for common queries or issues
3. Responses to frequently asked questions
4. Escalation points for complex issues requiring human intervention
5. Closing messages and feedback collection

Ensure the script is friendly, efficient, and aligns with my brand voice. Include suggestions for personalizing responses based on customer data.
